<h1 align="left">Hey 👋 What's up?</h1>

###

<p align="left">
I'm Jannis, a hobby developer from the beautiful country of Germany. When I'm not adventuring through the realms of code, you'll likely find me immersed in the world of anime, exploring epic narratives, and diverse characters. Coding and anime might seem worlds apart, but not to me. They both involve telling stories, either through lines of code or vibrant animation - and that is why I cherish them so much!

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
I'm a self-proclaimed bug creator since 2016, always aiming to squash them! I fell in love with coding when I realized I could turn my ideas into reality through code, and I've been on this journey ever since.<br>
  
🚀 At the moment, I’m soaring through the vast universe of Svelte and Spring, attempting to configure them in a Kubernetes cluster. It’s an exciting adventure filled with a lot of learning and, of course, a litany of debugging.<br>
  
💡 Fun Fact: I happened to claim that I use tabs over spaces… just for the record, I was joking. Who would ever commit such an act of rebellion?<br>
  
🌱 I believe that the tech industry is like a never-ending expedition. Every day, there's something new to explore. My upcoming exploration? Quantum computing and artificial intelligence, because who doesn’t love a good challenge?<br>
  
👨‍💻 Ah, and did I already mention my quote of the year? "It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature." That's a developer's life in a nutshell, isn't it?<br>
  
🎉 One of the best parts of coding? The beauty of syntax highlighting and auto-formatting tools. Some might call it developer aesthetics. To me, it's the artistry of coding.<br>
  
⌛ Clearly, coding consumes a large part of my life. Yet, when I'm offline, you'll find me diving back into the digital world, on an endless quest for how to code better. After all, a good developer never stops learning, right?<br>
  
🎯 As for goals, I aim to create some working apps, and by 'working', I mean without those undocumented features! With every line of code, I'm getting a step closer to my goal, one tab (not space) at a time.
